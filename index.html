                        Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English
                        mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose
                        computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure
                        calculation, and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result,
                        she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and one of the
                        first computer programmers.

            <p>
                In 1840, Babbage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his Analytical Engine.
                Luigi Menabrea, a young Italian engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy, transcribed Babbage's lecture into French,
                and this transcript was subsequently published in the Bibliothèque universelle de Genève in October 1842.
                Babbage's friend Charles Wheatstone commissioned Ada Lovelace to translate Menabrea's paper into English.
                She then augmented the paper with notes, which were added to the translation. Ada Lovelace spent the better part of a
                year doing this, assisted with input from Babbage. These notes, which are more extensive than Menabrea's paper,
                were then published in the September 1843 edition of Taylor's Scientific Memoirs under the initialism AAL.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ada Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, she describes an algorithm for the Analytical
                Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for
                implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason.
                The engine was never completed so her program was never tested.
            </p>

            <h2 id="2nd">3. Controversy over her actual contribution</h2>
            <p>
                Though Lovelace is referred to as the first computer programmer, some biographers, computer scientists and historians of computing claim otherwise.
                In their article about the countess, Eugene Eric Kim and Betty Alexandra Toole consider it "incorrect" to regard Lovelace
                as the first computer programmer, as Babbage wrote the initial programs for his Analytical Engine, although the majority
                were never published. Bromley notes several dozen sample programs prepared by Babbage between 1837 and 1840,
                all substantially predating Lovelace's notes. Dorothy K. Stein regards Lovelace's notes as "more a reflection of the
                mathematical uncertainty of the author, the political purposes of the inventor, and, above all, of the social and
                cultural context in which it was written, than a blueprint for a scientific development".

            </p>
            <p>
                However, Kim later added in his blog about the subject:
                "Her genius was in recognizing the brilliance and potential of Babbage’s invention,
                not just from a pie-in-the-sky perspective (Babbage himself was skilled in spinning yarns), but from a down-and-dirty,
                here’s-how-it-actually-works perspective. She was both a visionary and a hacker, a century ahead of her time."

            <h2 id="3rd">4. Commemoration</h2>
            <p>
                some of the ways the countess has been Commemorated for her contribution include
                The computer language Ada, created on behalf of the United States Department of Defense, was named after Lovelace.
                The reference manual for the language was approved on 10 December 1980 and the Department of Defense Military Standard for
                the language, MIL-STD-1815, was given the number of the year of her birth.

                        In addition, the Association for Women in Computing inaugurated its Ada Lovelace Award In 1981.
                        Since 1998, the British Computer Society (BCS) has awarded the Lovelace Medal, and in 2008 initiated an annual
                        competition for women students.[110] BCSWomen sponsors the Lovelace Colloquium, an annual conference for women
                        undergraduates.[110] Ada College is a further-education college in Tottenham Hale, London, focused on digital skills.
